**Project:** Image Classification on Animals Dataset

This project classifies 8 different categories of animals

**Dataset:** The dataset used for this task was collected from Kaggle, named 'Animal10' Dataset. It consists of images of ten different types of animals. The dataset does not consist of equal number of images of each type.

The categories that we have chosen here are Dogs, Chicken, Squirrel, Horse, Cat and Butterfly. The dataset also contains some random unrelated images.

**Libraries used:** TensorFlow API, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, cv2, classification_report

**Training Parameters:** 

•	Model built consists of 4 Conv2D layers, 2 MaxPooling layers, 5 Dropout layers.

•	Loss function: Categorical Cross Entropy

•	Optimizer: Adam

•	Implemented ‘Batch Normalization’ technique
